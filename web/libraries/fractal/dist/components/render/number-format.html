The number_format filter formats numbers. It is a wrapper around PHP's number_format function: <br>

200.35: 200 <br>
You can control the number of decimal places, decimal point, and thousands separator using the additional arguments: <br>

9800.333: 9,800.33
<br>

To format negative numbers, wrap the number with parentheses (needed because of Twig's precedence of operators: <br>

-9800.333: -9,800.33

<br>

-9800.333: -9,800.33

<br>
