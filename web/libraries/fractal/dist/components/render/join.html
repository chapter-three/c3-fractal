The join filter returns a string which is the concatenation of the items of a sequence: <br>

123 <br>

The separator between elements is an empty string per default, but you can define it with the optional first parameter: <br>

1|2|3 <br>

A second parameter can also be provided that will be the separator used between the last two items of the sequence: <br>

1, 2, 3
